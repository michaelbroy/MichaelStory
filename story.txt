Once upon a time there was a squirrel.  The squirrel lived in an office and,
ocasionally, stole food from the people who worked there.  This made the people
very sad, because lunch is all they had to look forward to.  Eventually, they
decided to hire the squirrel so he'd have enough money to buy his own food
instead of stealing other people's.  This was good for the people, but not the
squirrel, who had to fabricate most of the information on his resume to get the
job in the first place.
It was time for his first task, to copy 100 files and to pass it around the office. However, the squirrel did not know how to use the copy machine! He tried everything he can think of, putting acorns into the small cracks and opennings of the machine, tried asking it to copy, etc... However, one of the acorns jammed the machine and the machine, with a loud groan, broke down.
